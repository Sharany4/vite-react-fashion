I made this project so I can learnto use react, tpyescript, and learn more about front end developement.
This is the first time i have done any front end or worked with tpyescript or javascript.

Over the years I have made fashion projects and I wanted to be be able to list them and findthem with characteristics. 

So I made a click system that gives characteristics and finds those that match in teh list and displays them. 

The page that asks for the type is the home page. That then navigates to the fabrics pages, then the closure page, then the find page that dpiplays those found. 

If by accident the user finds themselves having skipped a page, the header will warn you to go to the start. If not, you can still navigate to the find page but will have no results.
